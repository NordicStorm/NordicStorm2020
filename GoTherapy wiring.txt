Right Spark:
Reading with Spark correct way: 
	Plug in a PWM cable with white on top, creating Control Right
	
Left Spark:
Reading with Spark correct way: 
	Plug in a PWM cable with white on top, creating Control Left
	
RC antenna control:
Reading correctly:
    Plug in PWM to CH1 with white on left, creating RC A
	Plug in single wire on left, creating RC B
	
Out of arduino:
2 -> RC A white
3 -> RC B
4 -> Control Right white (
5 -> Control Left white (

Ground Wire comes out of a 30amp PDP slot.
5v wire comes from Arduino 5v pin.
Arduino power wire goes from 12v slot on PDP to barrel connector on Arduino
Black of Control Right and Left goes to Ground Wire, as does RC A black.
RC A, Controls Right and Left red goes to 5v wire.

Spark power wires connect to 40amp PDP slots
Motors connect to their respective Spark controllers.
Battery goes through Main Breaker into PDP.
